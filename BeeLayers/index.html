					<h1>Antennae</h1>
					<p>	Bees often live in tree cavities and hives, 
						which have very low levels of light, so they 
						need to be able to sense without vision. The 
						antennae hold thousands of receptors for touch 
						(mechanoreceptors), smell (odour receptors) 
						and taste (gustatory receptors). Instead of 
						pressure sensitive ear drums like humans, 
						instead, touch receptors in their antennae 
						sense vibrations in the air that allow them 
						to hear airborne sound in close range.</p>

					<h1>Head</h1>
					<p>	The head stores the brain, eyes and antennae. Made  
						up of 950,000 neurones, the bee’s brain is small,  
						but is also able to divide and perform complex  
						tasks as well as communicate with the rest of  
						the body.</p>

					<h1>Eye</h1>
					<p>	Bees have two large compound eyes, made up   
						of ommatidium (light focusing groups of cells).  
						 A worker bee has about about 4,000-6,000 ommatidia  
						 but drones have more 7,000-8,600, perhaps due to   
						better vision required for mating. Like most insects,  
						 their eyes do not produce as higher quality image as  
						 humans, however they are much more sensitive to   
						motion detection.  
						 
					Bees also have three smaller simple eyes on the top of   
						their head called ocelli. These eyes don’t focus,   
						but are very sensitive in order to inform the bee   
						about light intensity.

					<h1>Mouth</h1>
					<p>	Unlike most insects, bees have mouths that can suck 
						(like moths), and chew (like grasshoppers). To do this,
						 they have both a jaw (mandible) and a proboscis.
						They use the mandible to chew wood, manipulate wax, 
						defending against enemy bees and mites, and cleaning 
						other bees. The proboscis is used to such honey, nectar 
						and water, and to exchange food with other bees.

					<p>Bees have two sets of wings, the front ones being 
						larger that the hind ones. During flight, the two 
						wings are hooked together by hooks along the edge of 
						the hind wing and act in synchronisation.
						Flight is controlled by the two main muscles in the 
						thorax, the longitudinal and vertical muscles. </p>

					<h1>Abdomen</h1>
					<p>The abdomen is the hind segment of a bee. The 
					different types of bees in a hive (drone, worker, queen) 
					can be differentiated by the size and shape of their 
					abdomens. It is home to the most of the bee’s internal 
					organs, and the stinger</p>

					<h1>Legs</h1>
					<p>Bees legs are very versatile, with claws and 
					pads that allow them to grip on both rough and smooth
					surfaces, anywhere from a tree trunk to glass.
					On their front legs, they have a special diet 
					used to clean pollen off their antennae.
					On the tibia of their back legs, bees have pollen
					baskets, which is used to carry pollen and propolis. 
					It is a cupped surface with hairs along the edges 
					and a long bristle that goes down the centre and 
					through the pollen pellet or propolis being carried
					to keep it in place whilst in flight.
					The legs also contain special structures for pressing 
					pollen for storage.

					<h1>Stinger</h1>
					<p>	The bee's stinger is a combination of internal and external organ in the abdomen. It is an evolved egg depositor - ovipositor - which has two lancets, delivering the venom made by the venom glands and stored in the venom sac. It is speculated that a bee’s stinger was inherited from their ancient wasp ancestors who would lay their eggs in the flesh of their prey. Given the stinger is a remnant of a female reproductive system, male bees generally can’t sting. Worker honey bees have barbed stingers that stick into the body of a mammal, causing part of her abdomen to be pulled out when she flies away, often killing her. Queen bees and species like bumblebees have smooth stingers, allowing them to repeatedly sting without dying.</p>
