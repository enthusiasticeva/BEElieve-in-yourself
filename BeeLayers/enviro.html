	<p id="whereexpl">Loss of bees would have a massive economic and environmental impact globally. Bees are essential for agriculture, a USDA study claims that nearly one in every three bites of food in an Americanâ€™s diet comes directly or indirectly from honey bee pollination. Bee populations are declining rapidly, predominately due to Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD), a phenomena where entire hives either disappear or die overnight. <br><br>
	Whilst it is not certain what causes this, it is much more common in bees that are transported long distances to pollinate plants, so some theorise that this travel puts stress on the bees that depress their immune system, exposing them to pathogens. Mites that feed on hives may be introducing pathogens to the bees, killing them. The pesticides and other chemicals on plants may be leading to illness in bees, either killing them or inhibiting their ability to get back to their hive.<br><br>
	Without bees, the agricultural industry would collapse, and it could lead to a lack of food and an economic nightmare. It would also cause many plants to die, allowing climate change to happen at a much faster rate.
