		<p  id = "stepone">Honey begins as nectar, the incentive plants give for pollinators to come to them. Nectar is a mix of sugar and the oils that give flowers their scents. Bees suck this up their proboscis into their stomachs, which they then fly back to the hive.
		</p>
		<p  id = "steptwo">When the foragers get back to the hive, they pass it to worker bees who begin to evaporate all of the water out of the nectar, converting it into honey. Nectar is about 70% water, where honey is only 20%, bees remove this water by swallowing and regurgitating it, and flapping their wings over filled cells of honey. </p>
		<p  id = "stepthree">In this process, the nectar turns into honey, with the sugars and oils it had before, mixed with enzymes from the bees digestive system. The thickness and colour of the honey varies with the plants it is harvested from. </p>

		<p  id = "YE">Yes and no, honey is predominately sugar, and sugar, in large quantities is bad for your health. That being said, the enzyme and oils in honey can have positive effect on the body, including a range of antibacterial properties, its low pH (comparable to orange juice) inhibits bacterial growth, when honey is diluted, it releases hydrogen peroxide, which kills bacteria. 
		</p>
		<p  id = "ES">Honey draws in moisture around it, know as being hygroscopic. This means that any bacteria around honey looses its moisture and dies. Because of these properties, it can be effective against antibiotic resistant organisms, so it is often applied to open wounds. The enzymes in honey also promote gut flora in humans, encouraging effective immune responses.</p>
		<p  id = "SY">It is not recommended to feed honey to young infants (up to 12-18 months old), as there are undetectable honey resistant bacteria, like Clostridium botulinum that are harmless to adults but can be fatal for very young kids.</p>
